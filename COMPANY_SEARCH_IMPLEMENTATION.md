# Company Search Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the global company search functionality in the frontend, as requested in the integration guide.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Global Search in Header
- **Search Bar**: Located in the header with placeholder "Search companies, projects, specs..."
- **Real-time Search**: As user types, search is triggered with 300ms debounce
- **Dropdown Results**: Shows search results in a dropdown with company details
- **Company Details**: Displays company name, description, creator, and status
- **Navigation**: Clicking a result navigates to the company details page

### ✅ Company Page Search
- **Dedicated Search Bar**: Added to the Companies page for focused company search
- **Search Feedback**: Shows "Searching for: [query]" when active
- **Clear Search**: X button to clear search and return to full list
- **Search Results**: Table updates to show only matching companies
- **Empty States**: Different messages for "no companies" vs "no search results"

### ✅ API Integration
- **Search Endpoint**: Uses `/api/v1/companies/?search=<query>` as specified
- **Case-insensitive**: Backend handles case-insensitive matching
- **Partial Matching**: Matches anywhere in company name, description, or creator email
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Technical Implementation

### Companies Store (`src/stores/companies.ts`)
```typescript
// New search function added
const searchCompanies = async (query: string) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams()
  params.append('search', query)
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/?${params.toString()}`, {
    headers: authStore.token ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${authStore.token}` } : undefined
  })
  
  // Returns formatted company data
  return rawCompanies.map((c: any) => ({
    ...c,
    createdBy: c.created_by || c.createdBy
  }))
}
```

### Header Component (`src/components/Layout/Header.vue`)
- **Search Integration**: Uses companies store for company searches
- **Enhanced UI**: Better dropdown styling with company status badges
- **Improved UX**: More detailed company information in results
- **Responsive**: Dropdown with max height and scroll for many results

### Companies Page (`src/views/CompaniesPage.vue`)
- **Search Bar**: Dedicated search input with clear button
- **Search State**: Tracks search query, results, and loading state
- **Dynamic Table**: Shows search results or all companies based on search state
- **Loading States**: Different loading messages for search vs initial load

## API Usage

### Search Request
```
GET /api/v1/companies/?search=hel
```

### Expected Response
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "HelloTech",
    "description": "Technology company",
    "status": "active",
    "created_by": "user@example.com",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## User Experience

### Global Search (Header)
1. User types in header search bar
2. After 300ms delay, search is triggered
3. Results appear in dropdown below search bar
4. Each result shows:
   - Company name
   - Description (if available)
   - Created by email
   - Status badge (active/inactive)
5. Clicking a result navigates to company details

### Company Page Search
1. User types in dedicated search bar
2. Search triggers immediately on input
3. Table updates to show only matching companies
4. Search status is shown below search bar
5. Clear button (X) resets search and shows all companies

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Shows "Failed to search" message
- Gracefully falls back to empty results
- Logs errors to console for debugging

### Empty Results
- Global search: "No results found"
- Company page: "No companies match your search criteria"
- Clear search option provided

### Loading States
- Global search: "Searching..." in dropdown
- Company page: "Searching companies..." with spinner

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Highlight Matches**: Highlight matching text in search results
2. **Search Filters**: Add filters for status, date range, etc.
3. **Search History**: Remember recent searches
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate results
5. **Search Analytics**: Track popular search terms
